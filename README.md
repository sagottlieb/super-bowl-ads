# Super Bowl Ads

A friend asked me to scrape data on super bowl ads from this site
https://admeter.usatoday.com/results/2020 for 2020, 2019, and 2018.

Desired output is a csv file for each year with columns

Year,Brand,Ad Name,Rank,Avg. Rating,Air Time,Link

where link is to admeter detail page for the ad (e.g. [https://admeter.usatoday.com/commercials/cashew/](https://admeter.usatoday.com/commercials/cashew/)).
